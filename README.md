## Huge Thanks
First of all, huge props and thanks to [@fuston](https://github.com/fustom) for the original work on his fantastic integration! https://github.com/fustom/ariston-remotethermo-home-assistant-v3

This extension is an experiment to support current remotethermo-based devices made by Elco. Once it is mature, I will open a pull-request to the original repository made by fustom.

## Integration was tested on and works with:
- Elco Aerotop Split
- All systems of the original repository

Feel free to test something else and create new issue / pull request if something goes wrong.
